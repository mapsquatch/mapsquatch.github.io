# Hello!

## About me

I'm currently a full-time data analyst at University of Illinois, part-time Library and Information Science student at the iSchool (also at Illinois), and proponent of active transportation (read: bicycling and walking). I've been learning R for the last couple years, used Python some in conjunction with GIS before that, and hope to get better at using GitHub for source control.

## About this site

This was created as part of a training seminar. Eventually I hope to get around to posting about the projects I've been working on.
